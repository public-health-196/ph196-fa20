    "The goal of this homework will be to analyze a paper and attempt to replicate the paper's model and findings. We'll be looking at **Prediction of Lifetime Risk for Cardiovascular Disease by Risk Factor Burden at 50 Years of Age**, which you can find [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.548206?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub\\%3dpubmed). The assignment will be broken down into two parts: 1) first, we'll be analyzing the paper's approach and methods, then 2) we'll attempt to replicate the findings. You are encouraged to complete all of the questions within the notebook, but if you would like to answer the written questions separately that is fine as long as you **submit all of your responses on Gradescope as 1 PDF and tag the pages appropriately**.\n",

    "In the last homework, we used regular linear regression for binary classification. A widely used alternative is logistic regression, a model that builds on top of linear regression. Instead of predicting in a range of continuous values, logistic regression models \"squash\" the predictions to be between 0 and 1. We can interpret these predictions as a probability $p$ of being in class 1. In this setting, we can also interpret predictions as a *risk score* for cardiovascular disease. Just like with the OLS regression model you used in homework 1, we threshold these predictions to get binary classifications. For example, you might declare a prediction of class 0 if $p < 0.5$ and class 1 if $p \\geq 0.5$. For completing this homework, you don't need to know the much about the details of logistic regression, but Data 100's textbook provides a good read if you're interested (<a href=\"https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/17/classification_prob.html\">Sections 17.1-17.3</a>). \n",

Your boss has noticed that lots of people who receive the medication are still ending up with cardiovascular disease. With only a limited supply, she thinks this medication would be best reallocated to others who would benefit more. She tells you to look at the data and build a model to predict which patients would not benefit from the medication, as measured by whether they go on to have a bad outcome even though they were given the medication. To do this, you’ll fit a model of who goes on to have that bad outcome -- cardiovascular disease — among just the people who were on the medication. Those with high scores will go on to have a bad outcome. Those with the lowest risk scores are the people who would do well on medicaiton, so they are given the medication.\n",
