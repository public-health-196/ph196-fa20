    "Your startup has burnt through all of its venture funding paying 5 doctors in a hospital to interpret a set of mammograms for very high risk patients, specifically whether they believe cancer is present. Your CEO and co-founder asks you, the Chief Prediction-Not-Causation Officer (CPNCO), to use this data to produce a model that predicts cancer based on a mammogram. You try to tell her we don’t see the truth (cancer), just want the doctors think; she tells you “Just do whatever Google would do.” Following the Google team's approach in the diabetic retinopathy paper you read for this class, you decide to use the majority vote as the \"true\" cancer label.\n",

Invoking your prerogative as the company’s CPNCO, you spend the last few thousand dollars of funding to acquire one last piece of data: biopsy results, for a subset of patients.

The dataset also contains a `location` variable that indexes whether the patient lives in a suburban/urban area (`location = 0`) vs a rural area (`location = 1`).  \n",
